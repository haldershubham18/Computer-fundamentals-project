# Project Documentation  

## Project Overview  
This is a static portfolio webpage built to showcase web development skills. The project focuses on semantic HTML, clean CSS, and proper use of Git for version control.

## Development Process  

### Step 1: Project Setup  
- Initialized Git repository using `git init`.  
- Created project structure with `index.html` and `style.css`.  
- Set up `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files.

### Step 2: Version Control Commits  

**Commit 1:**  
- Added initial HTML structure with semantic elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`).  
- Included basic meta tags and document outline.

**Commit 2:**  
- Improved HTML semantics by adding `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<nav>`.  
- Added accessibility attributes (`alt`, `aria-label`).  
- Structured content with proper heading hierarchy.

**Commit 3:**  
- Created `style.css` and linked to HTML.  
- Added CSS reset and basic typography styles.  
- Set up color variables and base layout.

**Commit 4:**  
- Implemented responsive design using Flexbox and media queries.  
- Styled navigation, hero section, and project cards.

**Commit 5:**  
- Added hover effects, transitions, and polished UI details.  
- Ensured cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness.

## Future Improvements  
- Add JavaScript for interactive elements (consol, form validation).  
- Optimize images and implement lazy loading.  
- Integrate a backend for dynamic content.  
- Enhance SEO with structured data and meta tags.
